Facebook Page Notifications
===========================

Since FB pages don't let you subscribe to updates, this sends you a text / email when a Facebook page gets updated.
The config file requires the page id or name, e.g. for Toyota's page you could use 'Toyota' or '197052454200'.

Requires
--------

- Pear::Mail  ( pear install mail ) 
- FB php sdk ( https://github.com/facebook/facebook-php-sdk )
- your own App ID / Secret for oauth graph requests.
